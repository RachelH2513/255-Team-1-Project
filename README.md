### Project Title: Using chemical analysis determine the origin of wines  


### Data Source
wine.data from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.  


### Problem/Question
Italian wine is produced in every region of Italy, home to some of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world. People can choose hundreds of wine grape varieties from Italy. As is known to us, each kind of grape wine has different chemical composition, which decide the taste, smell and nutritional value.
This project will try multiple approaches to build different classifier model to predict the result of
election.

### Potential Methods
We propose two methods to predict the election:
One is using existing records from data source 1 to make prediction. 
The second one is trying to collect data by ourselves from social media APIs such as either twitter and Facebook.

A brief description of the steps we will take to complete the project:
1. Data pre-processing: Importing libraries and data.
2. Data Analysis and Exploration
3. Data Cleaning: Only key words to be analyzed in each tweet.
4. Word cloud: Choose the word cloud for both electors’ supporters.
5. Vectorization of the pre-processed text
6. Build models and train.
7. Get the results.

### Measurement
The prediction is not only a result of who will win, but also it should include a ratio of the two group’s supporters.
