### Project Title: Using chemical analysis determine the origin of wines  


### Data Source
1. wine.data from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.  


### Problem/Question
Twitter has become an important communication channel of Election. People can announce a
viewpoint of election they’re observing with their smartphone. Based on these tweets, we can
statistic people’s preference of the election’s results.
This project will try multiple approaches to build different classifier model to predict the result of
election.

### Potential Methods
We propose two methods to predict the election:
One is using existing records from data source 1 to make prediction. 
The second one is trying to collect data by ourselves from social media APIs such as either twitter and Facebook.

A brief description of the steps we will take to complete the project:
1. Data pre-processing: Importing libraries and data.
2. Data Analysis and Exploration
3. Data Cleaning: Only key words to be analyzed in each tweet.
4. Word cloud: Choose the word cloud for both electors’ supporters.
5. Vectorization of the pre-processed text
6. Build models and train.
7. Get the results.

### Measurement
The prediction is not only a result of who will win, but also it should include a ratio of the two group’s supporters.
