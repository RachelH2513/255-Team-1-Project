### Project Title: Using chemical analysis determine the origin of wines  


### Data Source
wine.data from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/


### Preliminary Analysis  

#### Dataset Analysis  
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.  
First cleaning the data.  
1. Slightly editing csv version (added column names) and check if there is missing value to fix.
2. confirming the count of attributes.  

Analysing the dataset we can see:
