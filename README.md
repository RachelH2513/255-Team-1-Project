### Project Title: Using chemical analysis determine the origin of wines  


### Data Source
wine.data from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/


### Preliminary Analysis  

#### Dataset Analysis  
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 
First cleaning the data.  
1. Slightly editing csv version (added column names) and check if there is missing value to fix.
2. confirming the count of attributes.  

Analysing the dataset we can see:  
1. There is the distribution's count of chemistry of wines. As we can see there are 13 types of chemical in wines recorded in this data set, which means we only analyse these 13 type of chemicals in this project. Ash is the highest content of some types of wine. And for most of wines, the content of Malic acid is the lowes.
