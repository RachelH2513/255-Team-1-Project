### Problem/Question
Twitter has become an important communication channel of Election. People can announce a

2. Data Analysis and Exploration
3. Data Cleaning: Only key words to be analyzed in each tweet.
4. Word cloud: Choose the word cloud for both electors’ supporters.
5. Vectorization of the pre-processed text
6. Build models and train.
7. Get the results.
